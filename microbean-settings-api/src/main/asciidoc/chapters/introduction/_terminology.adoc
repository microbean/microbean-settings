=== Terminology

Unless otherwise noted, all terminology defined in this specification
is only for the purposes of this specification and none other.

[[application]]Application:: A Java program, especially one that is
made up of <<component,components>>. The term _application_ is also
sometimes used adjectivally, e.g. to distinguish application concerns
from <<component,component>> concerns.

[[component]]Component:: A Java class that does not declare, and hence
is not runnable via, a `static` `main` method, or a notional
collection of such classes, or a physical collection of such classes,
or a physical packaging of a collection of such
classes. <<application,Applications>> are assembled from components by
someone playing the <<application_assembler>> role.

[[configuration]]Configuration:: An externalized portion of
<<component,component>> state, or a snapshot of such a portion, that,
when imported into a <<component,component>> of a running
<<application,application>>, may cause the <<component,component>> to
change its behavior without there being any corresponding change in
its source code.
+
Configuration is most, but not all, of what makes up an
<<environment,environment>> and is typically that portion of an
<<environment,environment>> that is created by someone playing the
<<configuration_author>> role.
+
[sidebar]
Configuration often takes the form of textual, human-readable,
human-writable named values in a file, but need not be of this form.

[[configuration_coordinates]]Configuration Coordinates:: Notional
coordinates that partially locate a <<configuration,configuration>> in
<<configuration_space,configuration space>>.

[[configuration_loader]]Configuration Loader:: A notional
<<component,component>> that "knows" where
<<configuration,configuration>> lives within an
<<environment,environment>> and can load it on behalf of an
<<application,application>> or <<component,component>> when requested.

[[configuration_space]]Configuration Space:: The universe of all
possible <<configuration,configurations>> for all possible
<<component,components>> that are part of all possible
<<application,applications>>.
+
[sidebar]
Configuration space is a subset of <<environment_space,environment
space>>.

[[deploy]]Deploy:: To start an <<application,application>> in a
particular <<environment,environment>>.  <<deployment,Deployments>>
are carried out by someone playing the <<application_deployer>> role.

[[deployment]]Deployment:: The notional result of <<deploy,deploying>>
an <<application,application>>.

[[environment]]Environment:: A notional location in
<<environment_space,environment space>> into which an
<<application,application>> is <<deploy,deployed>>. An environment
comprises <<configuration,configurations>> and other data typically
outside of the responsibilities of the <<component_developer>> and
<<configuration_author>> roles, such as the current locale, the
machine architecture, the current time, the current working directory,
and so on.

[[environment_coordinates]]Environment Coordinates:: Notional
coordinates that partially or completely locate an
<<environment,environment>>, and its <<deploy,deployed>>
<<application,applications>>, in <<environment_space,environment
space>>.
+
[sidebar]
Environment coordinates are the "latitude and longitude", loosely
speaking, of an <<environment,environment>>, and hence its
<<deploy,deployed>> <<application,applications>>, within
<<environment_space,environment space>>.

[[environment_space]]Environment Space:: The universe of all possible
<<environment,environments>>, and hence all possible
<<configuration,configurations>>, for all possible
<<application,applications>>.

[[qualifier]]Qualifier:: An <<environment_coordinates,environment
coordinate>>, particularly one that is characterized by a name and a
textual value.
