[#terminology]
=== Terminology

Unless otherwise noted, all terminology defined in this specification
is only for the purposes of this specification and no other purposes.

[#notional_ontology]
==== Notional Ontology

.Notional Ontology

[#application]
==== Application

A Java program comprising <<component,components>> (and that may be a
<<component,component>> itself).

The term _application_ is also sometimes used adjectivally, e.g. to
distinguish <<application_concern,application concerns>> from
<<component_concern,component concerns>>.

NOTE: Although applications may be <<component,components>>
themselves, applications are the only things that can be
<<assemble,assembled>> and <<deploy,deployed>>.

****
An application may be as straightforward as a Java class with a
`static` `main` method, as simple as a unit test running in a test
harness, or as complicated as a Servlet application
<<deploy,deployed>> to an application server. What applications have
in common is:

 1. they are <<assemble,assembled>>
 2. once <<assemble,assembled>>, they may be <<deploy,deployed>> into
    an <<environment,environment>>
 3. they may be started and run in that <<environment,environment>>
****

[#application_concern]
==== Application Concern

Something that is properly the domain of an
<<application,application>>, rather than <<component_concern,of a
component>>.

[#assemble]
==== Assemble

To create an <<application,application>> out of
<<component,components>> and to prepare it for <<deploy,deployment>>
into an <<environment,environment>>.

NOTE: <<application,Applications>> are assembled from
<<component,components>> by someone playing the
<<application_assembler>> role.

[#component]
==== Component

A Java class containing business logic, or a notional collection of
such classes, or a physical collection of such classes, or a physical
packaging of such classes.

The term _component_ is also sometimes used adjectivally, e.g. to
distinguish <<component_concern,component concerns>> from
<<application_concern,application concerns>>.

NOTE: <<application,Applications>> are <<assemble,assembled>> from
components by someone playing the <<application_assembler>> role.

[#component_concern]
==== Component Concern

Something that is properly the domain of a <<component,component>>,
rather than <<application_concern,of an application>>.

[#configuration]
==== Configuration

An externalized, often persistent, portion of
<<component,component>> state, or a snapshot of such a portion, that,
when loaded into a <<component,component>> of a running
<<application,application>>, may cause the <<component,component>> to
change its behavior without there being any corresponding change in
its source code.

Configuration is most, but not all, of what makes up an
<<environment,environment>> and is typically that portion of an
<<environment,environment>> that is created by someone playing the
<<configuration_author>> role.

NOTE: A configuration's external representation often takes the form
of textual, human-readable, human-writable named values in a file, but
need not be of this form.

NOTE: Configuration is represented in this specification primarily as
a Java object that has been loaded into a <<component,component>> of a
running <<application,application>>.  _How_ its externalized form is
loaded into such an object is left deliberately unspecified.

[#configuration_coordinates]
==== Configuration Coordinates

Notional coordinates that partially locate a
<<configuration,configuration>> in <<configuration_space,configuration
space>>.

****
Configuration coordinates are often simple named textual values,
but are not to be confused with any simple named textual values that
may constitute a <<configuration,configuration's>> external
representation. They locate that state in
<<configuration_space,configuration space>>.
****

[#configuration_space]
==== Configuration Space

The universe of all possible <<configuration,configurations>> for all
possible <<component,components>> that are part of all possible
<<application,applications>>.

NOTE: Configuration space is a subset of
<<environment_space,environment space>>.

NOTE: <<qualifier,Qualifiers>> and <<path,paths>> combine to locate a
<<configuration,configuration>> in configuration space.

[#configuration_system]
==== Configuration System

A system of any kind that houses <<configuration,configuration>> in
such a way that it may be retrieved efficiently.

NOTE: For the <<use_cases,use cases>> described in this specification,
the <<component_developer>> does not interact with a configuration
system directly.

TIP: A configuration system may be as simple as a collection of files,
or may be as complicated as a dedicated program with an API.

[#deploy]
==== Deploy

To place an (<<assemble,assembled>>) <<application,application>> in a
particular <<environment,environment>> such that it may be started
later without any additional provided information, or to actually
start such a deployed <<application,application>>.

[#deployment]
==== Deployment

The notional result of <<deploy,deploying>> an
(<<assemble,assembled>>) <<application,application>> that is ready to
start.

[#environment]
==== Environment

A notional location in <<environment_space,environment space>> into
which an <<application,application>> is <<deploy,deployed>>.

An environment comprises <<configuration,configurations>> and other
data typically outside of the responsibilities of the
<<component_developer>> and <<configuration_author>> roles, such as
the current locale, the machine architecture, the current time, the
current working directory, and so on.

[#environment_coordinates]
==== Environment Coordinates

Notional identifiers that partially or completely locate an
<<environment,environment>>, and its <<deploy,deployed>>
<<application,applications>>, in <<environment_space,environment
space>>.

****
Environment coordinates are the "latitude and longitude", loosely
speaking, of an <<environment,environment>>, and hence its
<<deploy,deployed>> <<application,applications>>, within
<<environment_space,environment space>>.
****

NOTE: _Environment coordinates_ is a synonym for
<<qualifier,_qualifiers_>>.

[#environment_loader]
==== Environment Loader

A notional <<component,component>> that can provide access to an
<<environment,environment>> on behalf of an <<component,component>> or
<<application,application>> when requested.

The <<component_developer>> interacts directly with an environment
loader to acquire <<configuration,configuration>> and other
<<environment,environmental>> objects.

NOTE: An environment loader notionally bears the <<qualifier,qualifiers>> of
the <<application,application>> calling it.

[#environment_space]
==== Environment Space

The universe of all possible <<environment,environments>>, and hence
all possible <<configuration,configurations>>, for all possible
<<application,applications>>.

NOTE: <<qualifier,Qualifiers>> and <<path,paths>> help locate an
<<application,application>> and its <<environment,environment>> in
environment space.

[#path]
==== Path

A notional selector of a portion of an <<environment,environment's>>
state, typically supplied to an <<environment_loader,environment
loader>>.

A path notionally belongs to a <<pathspace,pathspace>>, i.e. of its
defining <<component,component>> or of its containing
<<application,application>>.

In general, paths that are defined by <<component,components>> must be
disambiguated by the <<application_assembler>> when an
<<application,application>> is <<assemble,assembled>>, so that two
<<component,components>> do not accidentally designate two different
Java types for the same path.

NOTE: Paths can be absolute or relative to some preexisting path.

[#pathspace]
==== Pathspace

A notional domain containing <<path,paths>>, much like a namespace is
a notional domain containing names.

For the purposes of this specification, a pathspace may be implicitly
defined by a <<component,component>> or an
<<application,application>>.

[#qualifier]
==== Qualifier

An <<environment_coordinates,environment coordinate>>, particularly
one that is characterized by a name and a textual value.

NOTE: _Qualifiers_ is a synonym for
<<environment_coordinates,_environment coordinates_>>.
