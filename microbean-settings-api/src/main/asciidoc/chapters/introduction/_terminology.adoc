[#terminology]
=== Terminology

Unless otherwise noted, all terminology defined in this specification
is only for the purposes of this specification and none other.

[#notional_ontology]
==== Notional Ontology

.Notional Ontology
image::ConfigurationOntology.png[]

[#application]
==== Application

A Java program, especially one that is made up of
<<component,components>> (and that may be a <<component,component>>
itself). The term _application_ is also sometimes used adjectivally,
e.g. to distinguish <<application_concern,application concerns>> from
<<component_concern,component concerns>>.

****
Although <<application,applications>> may be <<component,components>>,
applications are the only things that can be <<assemble,assembled>>
and <<deploy,deployed>>.

An application may be as straightforward as a Java class with a
`static` `main` method, as simple as a unit test running in a test
harness, or as complicated as a Servlet application
<<deploy,deployed>> to an application server. What applications have
in common is:

 1. they are <<assemble,assembled>>
 2. once <<assemble,assembled>>, they may be <<deploy,deployed>> into
    an <<environment,environment>>
****

[#application_concern]
==== Application Concern

Something that is properly the domain of an
<<application,application>>, particularly as distinguished from a
<<component_concern,component concern>>.

[#assemble]
==== Assemble

To create an <<application,application>> out of constituent
<<component,components>> and to prepare it for <<deploy,deployment>>
into an <<environment,environment>>.

****
<<application,Applications>> are assembled from
<<component,components>> by someone playing the
<<application_assembler>> role.
****

[#component]
==== Component

A Java class containing business logic, or a notional collection of
such classes, or a physical collection of such classes, or a physical
packaging of a collection of such classes. The term _component_ is
also sometimes used adjectivally, e.g. to distinguish
<<component_concern,component concerns>> from
<<application_concern,application concerns>>.

****
<<application,Applications>> are <<assemble,assembled>> from
components by someone playing the <<application_assembler>> role.
****

[#component_concern]
==== Component Concern

Something that is properly the domain of a <<component,component>>,
particularly as distinguished from an
<<application_concern,application concern>>.

[#configuration]
==== Configuration

An externalized, often persistent, portion of
<<component,component>> state, or a snapshot of such a portion, that,
when loaded into a <<component,component>> of a running
<<application,application>>, may cause the <<component,component>> to
change its behavior without there being any corresponding change in
its source code.

Configuration is most, but not all, of what makes up an
<<environment,environment>> and is typically that portion of an
<<environment,environment>> that is created by someone playing the
<<configuration_author>> role.

****
Configuration often takes the form of textual, human-readable,
human-writable named values in a file, but need not be of this form.
****

[#configuration_coordinates]
==== Configuration Coordinates

Notional coordinates that partially locate a
<<configuration,configuration>> in <<configuration_space,configuration
space>>.

****
Configuration coordinates are often simple named textual values, but
are not to be confused with any simple named textual values that may
constitute a <<configuration,configuration's>> state. They locate that
state in <<configuration_space,configuration space>>.
****

[#configuration_space]
==== Configuration Space

The universe of all possible <<configuration,configurations>> for all
possible <<component,components>> that are part of all possible
<<application,applications>>.

****
Configuration space is a subset of <<environment_space,environment
space>>.
****

[#deploy]
==== Deploy

To start an (<<assemble,assembled>>) <<application,application>> in a
particular <<environment,environment>>.  <<deployment,Deployments>>
are carried out by someone playing the <<application_deployer>> role.

[#deployment]
==== Deployment

The notional result of <<deploy,deploying>> an
(<<assemble,assembled>>) <<application,application>>.

[#environment]
==== Environment

A notional location in <<environment_space,environment space>> into
which an <<application,application>> is <<deploy,deployed>>. An
environment comprises <<configuration,configurations>> and other data
typically outside of the responsibilities of the
<<component_developer>> and <<configuration_author>> roles, such as
the current locale, the machine architecture, the current time, the
current working directory, and so on.

[#environment_coordinates]
==== Environment Coordinates

Notional coordinates that partially or completely locate an
<<environment,environment>>, and its <<deploy,deployed>>
<<application,applications>>, in <<environment_space,environment
space>>.

****
Environment coordinates are the "latitude and longitude", loosely
speaking, of an <<environment,environment>>, and hence its
<<deploy,deployed>> <<application,applications>>, within
<<environment_space,environment space>>.
****

[#environment_loader]
==== Environment Loader

A notional <<component,component>> that can load an
<<environment,environment>> on behalf of an <<component,component>> or
<<application,application>> when requested.

[#environment_space]
==== Environment Space

The universe of all possible <<environment,environments>>, and hence
all possible <<configuration,configurations>>, for all possible
<<application,applications>>.

[#qualifier]
==== Qualifier

An <<environment_coordinates,environment coordinate>>, particularly
one that is characterized by a name and a textual value.
