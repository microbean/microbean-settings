=== Goals

The following is a non-exhaustive list of goals in no particular order
that have guided and continue to guide the development of this
specification. They are also by extension the goals of any conforming
implementation.

Use Cases::

 * *Firstly*, this specification should focus on the <<use_cases,use
   cases>> of the <<component_developer>> as she seeks to acquire Java
   objects from an <<environment,environment>>.

 * *Secondly*, this specification should focus on the <<use_cases,use
   cases>> of the <<application_assembler>> as she seeks to
   <<assemble,combine disparate components into a Java application>>.

 * *Thirdly*, this specification should focus on any <<use_cases,use
   cases>> of the <<infrastructure_developer>> as she seeks to adapt a
   conforming implementation of this specification to her
   configuration management system.

Abstraction::

 * This specification should aim to abstract away as much as possible
   the details of how any <<configuration,configuration>> is
   represented persistently.

Self-Configurability::

 * A conforming implementation should be able to configure itself
   using itself, i.e. parts of the implementation should be able to
   use the implementation itself to acquire
   <<environment,environmental>> objects.

No Dependency Injection::

 * This specification should not be dependent upon or tied in any way
   to any dependency injection system.

 * A conforming implementation of this specification should be usable
   in any Java program, including those whose structure is defined by
   any of a variety of application frameworks.

 * This specification should have as few external dependencies as
   possible. This specification should aim to be at a fundamental
   enough layer within the architecture of a Java application that
   it can be used to configure itself and all the layers above it.

 * There should be no concept of "managed component" in this
   specification, as is found in other specifications like
   https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/3.0/jakarta-cdi-spec-3.0.html[CDI],
   https://jakarta.ee/specifications/managedbeans/2.0/jakarta-managed-beans-spec-2.0.html[Managed
   Beans] and so on.

Java 9 Compatibility::

 * This specification should allow conforming implementations to be
   https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=376[Java Platform Module
   System modules].

Configuration Discoverability::

 * A <<configuration,configuration>> that an application
   <<component,component>> needs should be discoverable in some way,
   perhaps with unspecified or vendor-defined tooling, by a
   <<configuration_author>> without requiring the
   <<component,component's>> source code.

Separation of Concerns::

 * <<component_concern,Component-level concerns>> and
   <<application_concern,application-level concerns>> should be
   separated as much as possible.

 * Where <<component_concern,component concerns>> conflict in a given
   <<application,application>>, mechansims should be provided by this
   specification to help resolve them.

 * The consumption and production of <<configuration,configurations>>
   and other <<environment,environmental>> objects should be separated
   as much as possible.

Early Failure::

 * Missing and otherwise invalid <<configuration,configurations>>
   should be detectable as early as possible, ideally before
   <<application,application>> <<deploy,deployment>>, or, in the worst
   cases, immediately upon startup after <<deploy,deployment>>.
