=== Purpose

This specification defines a set of Java APIs and behavioral contracts
for:

 * a <<component_developer>> to use in order to:

 ** <<environment_model_acquisition,acquire>> Java objects from
    <<environment,environments>>

 ** advertise the
    <<configuration,configuration>> her <<component,component>> needs

 * an <<application_assembler>> to use in order to
   <<disambiguation,disambiguate>> <<component_concern,component
   concerns>> while <<assemble,assembling>> an
   <<application,application>> for <<deploy,deployment>>

 * an <<infrastructure_developer>> to use in order to adapt a
   <<configuration_system,configuration system>> to a conforming
   implementation of this specification

 * a <<configuration_author>> to use in order to discover and create
   proper <<configuration,configurations>> for a given
   <<deploy,deployment>> of an <<application,application>> into an
   <<environment,environment>> containing those
   <<configuration,configurations>>

These APIs and contracts cleanly separate <<component,components>> and
<<application,applications>> from the <<environment,environments>>
into which they might be <<deploy,deployed>>.  They also separate the
consumption of <<configuration,configurations>> and other
<<environment,environmental>> objects from their production.
