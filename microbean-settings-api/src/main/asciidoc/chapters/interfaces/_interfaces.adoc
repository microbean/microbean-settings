=== The `Configured` Interface

The `org.microbean.settings.api.Configured` interface represents the
<<environment_loader,environment loader>> concept, and helps to
implement the <<environment_model_acquisition>> and
<<named_object_acquisition>> use cases.

==== The Bootstrap `configured()` Method

`Configured` defines a `static` `configured()` method that bootstraps the
system defined by this specification:

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Returns a non-{@code null} {@linkplain #root() root} {@link
 * Configured} that can be used to acquire configured objects.
 *
 * <p>The {@linkplain #root() root} {@link Configured} is located
 * using the {@link ServiceLoader}.  The first of all discovered
 * {@link Configured} instances is used and all others are ignored.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link Configured} that is loaded via this mechanism is
 * subject to the following restrictions:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>It must return a {@link Path} from its {@link
 * #absolutePath()} implementation that is equal to {@link
 * Path#root() Path.root()}.</li>
 *
 * <li>It must return itself from its {@link #parent()}
 * implementation.</li>
 *
 * <li>It must return itself from its {@link #get() get()}
 * method.</li>
 *
 * <li>It must return {@code true} from its {@link #isRoot()}
 * implementation.</li>
 *
 * <li>It must return itself from its {@link #root()} method.</li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>That <em>bootstrap</em> instance is then used to find the
 * "real" {@link Configured} implementation, which in most cases is
 * simply itself.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link Configured} that is supplied by the bootstrap
 * instance is subject to the following restrictions (which are
 * compatible with the instance's being the bootstrap instance
 * itself):</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>It must return a {@link Path} from its {@link
 * #absolutePath()} implementation that is equal to {@link
 * Path#root() Path.root()}.</li>
 *
 * <li>It must return the bootstrap instance from its {@link
 * #parent()} implementation.</li>
 *
 * <li>It must return a {@link Configured} implementation, normally
 * itself, from its {@link #get() get()} method.</li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This is the entry point for end users of this framework.</p>
 *
 * @return a non-{@code null} {@linkplain #root() root} {@link
 * Configured} that can be used to acquire configured objects
 *
 * @exception IllegalStateException if any of the restrictions above
 * is violated
