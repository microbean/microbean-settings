=== Value

The term "value" is something that keeps coming up and probably should
have a definition.  The challenge is: we don't want it to be something
handwavy.  The general idea is that a value in flight is just a Java
object (`String`, `int`, `MyStructuredObject`) but with additional
semantics (it may be <<presence,permanently or only currently present
or absent>>, for example).

=== Enumerating Environment Space

<<environment_space,Environment space>> is not fully enumerable. It
contains an infinity of <<path,paths>>. It is therefore nonsensical to
force an implementation of this specification to provide a set of all
<<path,paths>> for which there are values.

Does it make sense to provide the ability for an implementation of
this specification to provide a set of _some_ <<path,paths>> for which
there are values?
