== Use Cases

The following are significant use cases addressed by this
specification.  The specific ways in which the use cases are
implemented are discussed later in this specification.

[#environment_model_acquisition]
=== Environment Model Acquisition

==== Actors

 * <<component_developer>>
 * <<environment_loader,Environment Loader>>

==== Basic Case

 . While writing code for her component, the <<component_developer>>
   wants to acquire a single Java object whose class she has designed
   that models the current <<component,component's>>
   <<environment,environment>>.

 . She invokes a method on a specification-defined
   <<environment_loader,environment loader>>, supplying it with the
   class designating the type of object that she wants to acquire.

 .. The <<qualifier,qualifiers>> for the current
    <<application,application>> are determined automatically.

 . The <<environment_loader,environment loader>> takes the
   <<application,application's>> <<qualifier,qualifiers>> into
   consideration as well as the desired
   <<environment,environment>>-modeling class, and arranges for the
   proper object of that class representing the current qualified
   <<application,application's>> <<environment,environment>> to be
   selected, instantiated and retrieved.

[#named_object_acquisition]
=== Named Object Acquisition

==== Actors

 * <<component_developer>>
 * <<environment_loader,Environment Loader>>
 * <<application_assembler>>

==== Basic Case

 . While writing code for her component, the <<component_developer>>
   wants to acquire a _portion_ of a <<component,component's>>
   <<environment,environment>>, represented as a Java object whose
   class she may or may not have designed.
+
****
The object may be a simple scalar value, such as a `String` or an
`Integer`, a primitive type, such as `int`, a collection-like object,
such as an array or a `List` or a `Map`, or any other kind of object.
****

 .. The object representing the portion is qualified by a particular
    <<path,path>> belonging notionally to the <<component,component>>
    pathspace. The <<path,path>> may consist of, effectively, a single
    name, or multiple name components.
+
NOTE: A <<path,path>> that is effectively a single name used to
retrieve an object that is a simple scalar value models retrieving a
"property", a use case found in many other configuration frameworks.

 . She invokes a method on a specification-defined
   <<environment_loader,environment loader>>, supplying it with the
   <<component,component>>-<<pathspace,pathspaced>> <<path,path>> and
   the class designating the object she wants.

 .. The <<qualifier,qualifiers>> for the current
    <<application,application>> are determined automatically.

 .. The <<environment_loader,environment loader>> consults
    <<disambiguation,disambiguation>> information supplied by the
    <<application_assembler>>, if there is any, and transliterates the
    <<component,component>>-<<pathspace,pathspaced>> <<path,path>>
    into an equivalent
    <<application,application>>-<<pathspace,pathspaced>>
    <<path,path>>, thus turning a <<component_concern,component
    concern>> into an equivalent <<application_concern,application
    concern>>.

 . The <<environment_loader,environment loader>> takes this (possibly
   transliterated) <<path,path>> designating the portion of the
   <<environment,environment>> to retrieve, the
   <<application,application>> <<qualifier,qualifiers>> and the
   supplied class into consideration, and arranges for the proper
   object to be instantiated and retrieved.

[#disambiguation]
=== Disambiguation

==== Actors

 * <<application_assembler>>
 * <<environment_loader,Environment Loader>>

==== Basic Case

 . The <<application_assembler>> wants to resolve the ambiguity
   introduced when two <<component,components>> that she is
   <<assemble,assembling>> into an <<application,application>> define,
   intentionally or unintentionally, equal <<path,paths>> that target
   two different kinds of objects. To do this, she must
   _transliterate_ at least one of the <<path,paths>> in question.

 . To transliterate a <<component,component>>-defined
   <<path,path>>, she supplies <<configuration,configuration>> that
   maps the relevant <<component,component>>-defined <<path,path>> to
   an equivalent <<application,application>>-defined <<path,path>>
   featuring different but semantically equal path elements, thus
   disambiguating it, to the <<environment_loader,environment
   loader>> defined by this specification itself.

 . The <<environment_loader,environment loader>> discovers or
   otherwise accepts this supplied <<configuration,configuration>> and
   applies its disambiguation semantics automatically for the lifetime
   of the <<application,application>>, particularly during the
   <<named_object_acquisition>> use case.

==== Alternate Case: Retargeting

 . The <<application_assembler>> may want to ensure that, if two
   <<component,components>> that she is <<assemble,assembling>> into
   an <<application,application>> define, intentionally or
   unintentionally, different <<path,paths>> that target the same kind
   of object, the <<component,components>> will actually use a single
   <<application,application>>-defined <<path,path>> targeting that
   kind of object instead.

 .. Consolidating <<path,paths>> in this way may help the
    <<configuration_author>> in her goal to avoid duplication of
    <<configuration,configuration>> values.

 .. In such a case, at least one of the <<path,paths>> will need to be
    _transliterated_.

 . To transliterate any <<component,component>>-defined
   <<path,paths>>, she supplies <<configuration,configuration>> that
   maps the relevant <<component,component>>-defined <<path,paths>> to
   <<application,application>>-defined <<path,paths>>, thus
   disambiguating them, to the <<environment_loader,environment
   loader>> defined by this specification itself.

 . The <<environment_loader,environment loader>> discovers or
   otherwise accepts this supplied <<configuration,configuration>> and
   applies its disambiguation semantics automatically for the lifetime
   of the <<application,application>>, particularly during the
   <<named_object_acquisition>> use case.
