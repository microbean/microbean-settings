=== Java Naming and Directory Interface

Known now mostly as a library for accessing LDAP servers,
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.naming/javax/naming/package-summary.html[JNDI]
is actually primarily a specification for what amounts to
<<named_object_acquisition,the Named Object Acquisition use case>>,
complete with namespace resolution, partial or complete
<<environment,environmental>> object acquisition, user-supplied
factories, composite naming systems and so on.  This specification
leans heavily on the concepts at the heart of the "read-only" parts of
JNDI.

=== DropWizard

https://www.dropwizard.io/[DropWizard]
https://www.dropwizard.io/en/latest/getting-started.html#creating-a-configuration-class[forces
an application to model its entire configuration as a Java object that
is deserialized by Jackson] (often thought of incorrectly as just a
JSON library).  This specification leans heavily on DropWizard's
insistence that configuration be modeled up front and by the user, and
imagines a deliberately unspecified "back end" to permit technologies
other than
https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson#jackson-project-home-github[Jackson]
to play the role of object deserializer.

=== Spring Boot's Type-Safe Configuration Properties

Spring Boot's
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties[type-safe
configuration properties] has a mechanism for deserializing Java
objects from
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config.yaml[YAML],
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config.application-json[JSON]
and
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config.files[Java
properties files].  Spring Boot also has a deliberately opinionated
position on how externalized configuration is layered and stacked,
which, though flawed at its core, has inspired almost every other Java
configuration framework in existence.
