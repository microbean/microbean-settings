# microBean™ Settings

The microBean™ Settings framework serves as a single locus from which
a [CDI](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/2.0/apidocs/)-based Java
program may read _settings_: deployment-time information and
configuration often packaged externally with respect to the program
that tailors that program to its runtime environment.

Please see the
[overview](https://microbean.github.io/microbean-settings/apidocs/overview-summary.html)
for essential information.
