  <h1>microBean&trade; Settings</h1>

  <p>The microBean&trade; Settings library serves as a single locus
    from which a Java program may read <em>settings</em>:
    deployment-time information and configuration often packaged
    externally with respect to the program that tailors that program
    to its runtime environment.</p>

  <h2>Essential Settings Terminology</h2>

  <h3>Setting</h3>

  <p>A <em>setting</em> is a non-specific conceptual entity that
    loosely and imprecisely describes an aspect of something that can
    be externally configured.</p>

  <p>The term as commonly used is slippery and ambiguous.  Sometimes
    people use "setting" to mean the <em>name</em> of a property or
    attribute that can be externally configured in some way ("the
    setting that controls debug information", "what's the {@code debug}
    setting set to?").  Other times people use "setting" to mean a
    particular
    <em>value</em> of something that can be externally configured
    ("what's the setting for the {@code debug} property?").  Still
    other times people use "setting" to mean an environmentallly
    specific particular value of something that can be configured
    ("use the {@code staging} environment setting for {@code
    debug}").</p>

  <p>Due in part to this ambiguity, this project deliberately does not
    represent a setting in Java code.  Instead, this project carefully
    distinguishes between <em>setting names</em>, <em>setting
      values</em>, and <em>qualifiers</em>.</p>

  <h3>Setting Name</h3>

  <p>A <em>setting name</em> is fundamentally a {@link
    java.lang.String}.  It is not hierarchical.  It is treated as a
    unique key that, together with
    <em>qualifiers</em>, which will be discussed later, can pick out a
    maximally <em>suitable</em> setting value from among many possible
    suitable setting values.</p>

  <p>For example, the setting name for a hypothetical {@code debug}
    setting should be, simply, {@code debug}, even if there could be
    many potentially suitable values for this setting.  Potentially
    suitable (and potentially incompatible) values might include:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>a value for the {@code debug} setting in the {@code
      production} environment, all else being equal</li>

    <li>a value for it in the {@code development} environment, all
      else being equal</li>

    <li>a value for it in the {@code east} data center region, all
      else being equal</li>

    <li>a value for it if a given feature test is underway but only in
      the {@code east} data center region but regardless of
      environment</li>

    <li>a last-ditch value for it that is somewhat suitable in all
      other cases</li>

  </ul>

  <p>â€¦and so on.</p>

  <p>To belabor the point, and most notably in this example, the
    setting name would <em>not</em> be anything like {@code
    production.debug}, or {@code development.debug} or {@code
    east.debug}, because setting names are not hierarchical.  It would
    be, simply, {@code debug}.  The mechanism to distinguish between
    these hypothetical setting values in the absence of hierarchical
    setting names, <em>qualifiers</em>, will be discussed below.</p>

  <h3>Setting Value</h3>

  <p>A setting value is, fundamentally and deliberately, a {@link
    java.lang.String}, since that is the form that most settings are
    stored in, and also particularly since, being configuration
    information, setting values are designed to be human-editable.</p>

  <p>Setting values conceptually are always paired with the name of
    the setting they are associated with.  Bear in mind, however, that
    <em>several potential</em> setting values may be associated with
    any given setting name.  Some of them may be <em>suitable</em> in
    one particular application but not in another.
    <em>Suitability</em> is covered later below.</p>

  <h3>Source</h3>

  <p>A setting value conceptually originates from a <em>source</em>,
    which is simply and somewhat circularly any furnisher of setting
    values.  Sources are represented in Java code in this project by
    instances of the {@link org.microbean.settings.Source} class.</p>

  <p>In this project, a {@link org.microbean.settings.Source} is the
    most atomic unit of value acquisition and serves as a fa&ccedil;ade
    on top of systems ranging from simple text files to entire
    configuration subsystems.  Colloquially speaking, you can
    {@linkplain org.microbean.settings.Source#getValue(java.lang.String,
    java.util.Set) ask} a {@link org.microbean.settings.Source} for a
    {@link org.microbean.settings.Value} that is suitable for a setting
    named by a particular setting name, and it will respond with zero or
    one of them.</p>

  <h3>Setting Value Acquisition</h3>

  <p><em>Setting value acquisition</em> is the process of acquiring a
    setting value given a setting name and some information about the
    settings space in which the acquisition is taking place.</p>

  <p>This settings space information is more precisely known as
    <em>qualifiers</em>.</p>

  <h4>Qualifiers</h4>

  <p>A <em>qualifier</em> is a conceptual pairing of an named
    environmental aspect and its value that, together, pick out a
    coordinate in overall <em>settings space</em>.</p>

  <p>Consider a hypothetical, deliberately simplified cloud provider
    that deploys many applications across {@code east} and {@code
    west} data center {@code region}s, and places them into {@code
    development}, {@code staging} and {@code production} {@code
    environment}s, and conducts named {@code featureTest}s across
    them.  A program running in this world has
    coordinates&mdash;qualifiers&mdash;in this settings space.
    Specifically, a program's settings space qualifiers identify it in
    this hypothetical world by <em>qualifying</em> its location in
    settings space: along the {@code environment} axis ({@code
    environment=development}, or {@code environment=staging}, or
    {@code environment=production}), its location along the {@code
    region} axis ({@code region=east} or {@code region=west}), and its
    location along the {@code featureTest} axis ({@code
    featureTest=blinkTag} or {@code featureTest=autoplay} or a
    potentially infinite number of other possibilities).</p>

  <p>It is extremely important to understand that <strong>qualifiers,
      like setting names, are not inherently hierarchichal</strong>.
    For example, given two setting values, one qualified with {@code
    environment=development} and {@code region=east}, and another
    qualified with {@code environment=development} and {@code
    featureTest=blinkTag}, which is "best" for an application in the
    {@code development} environment, running in the {@code east}
    region and undergoing the {@code blinkTag} feature test?  It is
    not immediately clear, and this is why setting names and
    qualifiers are not expressed in terms of a hierarchical
    namespace.</p>

  <h4>Setting Value Request</h4>

  <p>A <em>setting value request</em> is the logical sending of a
    pair of a setting name and some qualifiers to one or more
    sources.</p>

  <p>A well-behaved source that is provided with this information
    will either furnish exactly one setting value for the conceptual
    setting identified by the setting value request, or will indicate
    that it can furnish no suitable setting value.</p>

  <p>If a source furnishes a setting value, then the value is said to
    be <em>suitable to some degree</em>.</p>

  <h4>Setting Value Response</h4>

  <p>A <em>setting value response</em> is the logical sending of a
    logical tuple consisting of a setting name, a suitable setting
    value, and a subset of the setting value request's qualifiers from
    which a degree of <em>suitability</em> is derived in response to
    the reception of a setting value request.</p>

  <h4>Suitability</h4>

  <p>A setting value response's <em>suitability</em> for its
    corresponding setting value request is a measure of how
    suited&mdash;how tailored, how specific&mdash;its associated
    setting value is for a given setting value request.</p>

  <p>Setting value response suitability is represented by the fact
    that a setting value response has qualifiers, in a manner similar
    to how a setting value request has qualifiers.  To be <em>at
      all</em> suitable, a setting value response's qualifiers must be
    either equal in kind and number to the set of qualifiers present in
    the corresponding setting value request, or a subset in kind and
    number of those qualifiers.</p>

  <p>Therefore, a setting value response whose qualifiers are smaller
    in number than the qualifiers in its corresponding value
    acquisition request is less suitable for the setting in question
    than a setting value whose qualifiers are equal in number to the
    qualifiers in its corresponding setting value request.</p>

  <p>Colloquially speaking, in other words, if a value acquisition
    request for a setting named {@code debug} arrives at a source with
    qualifiers <code>{environment=production, region=east}</code>, then
    a setting value response whose qualifiers are
    <code>{environment=production}</code> is less suitable for that
    setting value request than a setting value response whose
    qualifiers are <code>{environment=production, region=east}</code>,
    and a setting value response whose qualifiers are empty is the
    least suitable of all possible setting values for that value
    acquisition request.</p>
