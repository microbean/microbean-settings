  <h1>microBean&trade; Settings</h1>

  <p>
    The microBean&trade; Settings framework serves as a single locus
    from which
    a <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/2.0/apidocs/"
    target="_parent">CDI</a>-based Java program may
    read <em>settings</em>: deployment-time information and
    configuration often packaged externally with respect to the
    program that tailors that program to its runtime environment.
  </p>

  <h2>Essential Settings Terminology</h2>

  <h3 id="setting">Setting</h3>

  <p>
    A <em>setting</em> is a non-specific conceptual entity that
    loosely and imprecisely describes an aspect of something that can
    be externally configured.
  </p>

  <p>
    The term as commonly used is slippery and ambiguous.  Sometimes
    people use "setting" to mean the <em>name</em> of a property or
    attribute that can be externally configured in some way ("the
    setting that controls debug information", "what's the <code>debug</code>
    setting set to?").  Other times people use "setting" to mean a
    particular
    <em>value</em> of something that can be externally configured
    ("what's the setting for the <code>debug</code> property?").  Still
    other times people use "setting" to mean an environmentallly
    specific particular value of something that can be configured
    ("use the <code>staging</code> environment setting for <code>debug</code>").
  </p>

  <p>
    Due in part to this ambiguity, this project deliberately does not
    represent a setting in Java code.  Instead, this project carefully
    distinguishes between <em>setting names</em>, <em>setting
      values</em>, and <em>qualifiers</em>.
  </p>

  <h3 id="setting_name">Setting Name</h3>

  <p>
    A <em>setting name</em> is fundamentally a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in java.lang"><code>String</code></a>.  It is not hierarchical.  It is treated as a
    unique key that, together with
    <em>qualifiers</em>, which will be discussed later, can pick out a
    maximally <em>suitable</em> setting value from among many possible
    suitable setting values.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, the setting name for a hypothetical <code>debug</code>
    setting should be, simply, <code>debug</code>, even if there could be
    many potentially suitable values for this setting.  Potentially
    suitable (and potentially incompatible) values might include:
  </p>

  <ul>

    <li>a value for the <code>debug</code> setting in the <code>production</code> environment, all else being equal</li>

    <li>a value for it in the <code>development</code> environment, all
      else being equal</li>

    <li>a value for it in the <code>east</code> data center region, all
      else being equal</li>

    <li>a value for it if a given feature test is underway but only in
      the <code>east</code> data center region but regardless of
      environment</li>

    <li>a last-ditch value for it that is somewhat suitable in all
      other cases</li>

  </ul>

  <p>…and so on.</p>

  <p>
    To belabor the point, and most notably in this example, the
    setting name would <em>not</em> be anything like <code>production.debug</code>, or <code>development.debug</code> or <code>east.debug</code>, because setting names are not hierarchical.  It would
    be, simply, <code>debug</code>.  The mechanism to distinguish between
    these hypothetical setting values in the absence of hierarchical
    setting names, <em>qualifiers</em>, will be discussed below.
  </p>

  <h3 id="setting_value">Setting Value</h3>

  <p>
    A setting value is, fundamentally and deliberately, a textual
    value, since that is the form in which most setting values are
    stored, and also particularly since, being configuration
    information, setting values are designed to be human-editable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Setting values conceptually are always paired with the setting
    name they are associated with.  Bear in mind, however, that
    <em>several potential</em> setting values may be associated with
    any given setting name.  Some of them may be <em>suitable</em> in
    one particular application but not in another.
    <em>Suitability</em> is covered later below.
  </p>

  <h3 id="source">Source</h3>

  <p>
    A setting value conceptually originates from a <em>source</em>,
    which is simply and somewhat circularly any furnisher of setting
    values.  Sources are represented in Java code in this project by
    instances of the <a href="org/microbean/settings/Source.html" title="class in org.microbean.settings"><code>Source</code></a> class.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this project, a <a href="org/microbean/settings/Source.html" title="class in org.microbean.settings"><code>Source</code></a> is the
    most atomic unit of value acquisition and serves as a fa&ccedil;ade
    on top of systems ranging from simple text files to entire
    configuration subsystems.  Colloquially speaking, you can
    <a href="org/microbean/settings/Source.html#getValue-java.lang.String-java.util.Set-">ask</a> a <a href="org/microbean/settings/Source.html" title="class in org.microbean.settings"><code>Source</code></a> for a
    <a href="org/microbean/settings/Value.html" title="class in org.microbean.settings"><code>Value</code></a> that is suitable for a setting
    named by a particular setting name, and it will respond with zero or
    one of them.
  </p>

  <h3 id="setting_value_acquisition">Setting Value Acquisition</h3>

  <p>
    <em>Setting value acquisition</em> is the process of acquiring a
    setting value given a setting name and some information about the
    settings space in which the acquisition is taking place.
  </p>

  <p>
    This settings space information is more precisely known as
    <em>qualifiers</em>.
  </p>

  <h4 id="qualifiers">Qualifiers</h4>

  <p>
    A <em>qualifier</em> is a conceptual pairing of an named
    environmental aspect and its value that, together, pick out a
    coordinate in overall <em>settings space</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Consider a hypothetical, deliberately simplified cloud provider
    that deploys many applications across <code>east</code> and <code>west</code> data center <code>region</code>s, and places them into <code>development</code>, <code>staging</code> and <code>production</code> <code>environment</code>s, and conducts named <code>featureTest</code>s across
    them.  A program running in this world has
    coordinates&mdash;qualifiers&mdash;in this settings space.
    Specifically, a program's settings space qualifiers identify it in
    this hypothetical world by <em>qualifying</em> its location in
    settings space: along the <code>environment</code> axis (<code>environment=development</code>, or <code>environment=staging</code>, or
    <code>environment=production</code>), its location along the <code>region</code> axis (<code>region=east</code> or <code>region=west</code>), and its
    location along the <code>featureTest</code> axis (<code>featureTest=blinkTag</code> or <code>featureTest=autoplay</code> or a
    potentially infinite number of other possibilities).
  </p>

  <p>
    It is extremely important to understand that <strong>qualifiers,
    like setting names, are not inherently hierarchichal</strong>.
    For example, given two setting values, one qualified with <code>environment=development</code> and <code>region=east</code>, and another
    qualified with <code>environment=development</code> and <code>featureTest=blinkTag</code>, which is "best" for an application in the
    <code>development</code> environment, running in the <code>east</code>
    region and undergoing the <code>blinkTag</code> feature test?  It is
    not immediately clear, and this is why setting names and
    qualifiers are not expressed in terms of a hierarchical namespace.
  </p>

  <p>
    A qualifier is represented in Java code in this project by
    instances of the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/annotation/Annotation.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in java.lang.annotation"><code>Annotation</code></a> class,
    following the lead of a similar concept
    in <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/2.0/cdi-spec-2.0.html#qualifiers">CDI</a>.
  </p>

  <h4 id="setting_value_request">Setting Value Request</h4>

  <p>
    A <em>setting value request</em> is the logical sending of a pair
    of a setting name and some qualifiers to one or more sources.
  </p>

  <p>
    A well-behaved source that is provided with this information will
    either furnish exactly one setting value for the conceptual
    setting identified by the setting value request, or will indicate
    that it can furnish no suitable setting value.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a source furnishes a setting value, then the value is said to
    be <em>suitable to some degree</em>.
  </p>

  <h4 id="setting_value_response">Setting Value Response</h4>

  <p>
    A <em>setting value response</em> is the logical sending of a
    logical tuple consisting of a setting name, a suitable setting
    value, and a subset of the setting value request's qualifiers from
    which a degree of <em>suitability</em> is derived in response to
    the reception of a setting value request.
  </p>

  <h4 id="suitability">Suitability</h4>

  <p>
    A setting value response's <em>suitability</em> for its
    corresponding setting value request is a measure of how
    suited&mdash;how tailored, how specific&mdash;its associated
    setting value is for a given setting value request.
  </p>

  <p>
    Setting value response suitability is represented by the fact that
    a setting value response has qualifiers, in a manner similar to
    how a setting value request has qualifiers.  To be <em>at all</em>
    suitable, a setting value response's qualifiers must be either
    equal in kind and number to the set of qualifiers present in the
    corresponding setting value request, or a subset in kind and
    number of those qualifiers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therefore, a setting value response whose qualifiers are smaller
    in number than the qualifiers in its corresponding value
    acquisition request is less suitable for the setting in question
    than a setting value whose qualifiers are equal in number to the
    qualifiers in its corresponding setting value request.
  </p>

  <p>
    Colloquially speaking, in other words, if a value acquisition
    request for a setting named <code>debug</code> arrives at a source with
    qualifiers <code>{environment=production, region=east}</code>, then
    a setting value response whose qualifiers are
    <code>{environment=production}</code> is less suitable for that
    setting value request than a setting value response whose
    qualifiers are <code>{environment=production, region=east}</code>,
    and a setting value response whose qualifiers are empty is the
    least suitable of all possible setting values for that value
    acquisition request.
  </p>

  <h4 id="ambiguity">Ambiguity and Value Arbitration</h4>

  <p>
    When each of two sources responds to a setting value request, a
    requester must choose between them.  Sometimes, choosing is easy:
    if there is only one suitable setting value response, then there
    is no question that its associated setting value is the one that
    should be used, or if there is one setting value response that is
    more <a href="#suitability">suitable</a> than another, then
    obviously the more suitable one should be chosen.  But if two
    setting value requests are equally suitable, some other mechanism
    to disambiguate them must be used.  This is called <em>value
    arbitration</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Value arbitration is carried out by an <em>arbiter</em>.  An
    arbiter is a notional resolver of otherwise ambiguous value
    acquisition responses.  It receives two or more value acquisition
    responses with equal suitability and uses whatever heuristic it
    likes to choose between them.  Arbiters are represented in Java
    code in this project by instances of the <a href="org/microbean/settings/Arbiter.html" title="class in org.microbean.settings"><code>Arbiter</code></a> class.
  </p>

  <p>
    If an arbiter cannot arbitrate multiple ambiguous setting value
    acquisition responses, then the overall process of value
    acquisition fails.
  </p>

  <h3 id="interpolation">Interpolation</h3>

  <p>
    A setting value may contain references to other setting names for
    which setting value requests should be issued.  Processing these
    references is known as <em>interpolation</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    All interpolation in this project is carried out by an
    implementation of
    the <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/expression-language/3.0/">Jakarta
    Expression Language</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, in this project, for a setting name of, say, <code>javaHomeDescription</code>, a potentially suitable setting value of
    "<code>Your java.home variable is:
    ${settings['java.home']}</code>" will be interpreted such that
    during setting value acquisition a setting value request will be
    issued for a setting named <code>java.home</code>, and any value
    received for <em>that</em> setting name will replace
    "<code>${settings['java.home']}</code>".
  </p>

  <h3 id="conversion">Conversion</h3>

  <p>
    Once a setting value has been successfully acquired, it might need
    to be converted into a suitable type.  For example, a setting
    value of "<code>1</code>"&mdash;a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in java.lang"><code>String</code></a>&mdash;might
    be better represented within Java code as an <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in java.lang"><code>Integer</code></a>.  <em>Conversion</em> is the process of
    transforming a (definitionally) textual-typed setting value (such
    as a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in java.lang"><code>String</code></a>) into another data type
    representation (such as an <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in java.lang"><code>Integer</code></a>).
  </p>

  <h4 id="converter">Converter</h4>

  <p>
    A <em>converter</em> is a notional, preferably stateless entity
    that can accept a (definitionally textual) setting value and
    without changing its meaning represent it using a particular
    programming language data type.  Converters are represented in
    Java code in this project by implementations of the <a href="org/microbean/settings/Converter.html" title="interface in org.microbean.settings"><code>Converter</code></a> interface.
  </p>

  <h2 id="essential_classes">Essential Classes</h2>

  <p>
    In this project, the <a href="org/microbean/settings/Settings.html" title="class in org.microbean.settings"><code>Settings</code></a> class
    encapsulates all aspects
    of <a href="#setting_value_acquisition">setting value
    acquisition</a> described above.  A <a href="org/microbean/settings/Settings.html" title="class in org.microbean.settings"><code>Settings</code></a> instance gathers together <a href="org/microbean/settings/Source.html" title="class in org.microbean.settings"><code>Source</code></a>s, <a href="org/microbean/settings/Arbiter.html" title="class in org.microbean.settings"><code>Arbiter</code></a>s, <a href="org/microbean/settings/Converter.html" title="interface in org.microbean.settings"><code>Converter</code></a>s and a pluggable implementation
    of
    the <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/expression-language/3.0/">Jakarta
